LinkedList data structure

As a project, I created a LinkedList class given only descriptions of the methods to use. I wrote the methods and constructors from scratch as well as the JUnit for testing the data structure. I created a directory of methods at the top with line numbers but the indentation messed up when uploaded from Eclipse.

The main LinkedList class contains an empty constructor, workhorse constructor, copy constructor, and over 25 methods to help add, remove, return properties, manipulate the list, compare lists, and present the list.
